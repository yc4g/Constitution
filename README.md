## WHO WE ARE
Yale Code4Good is Yale's first undergraduate organizaton that harnesses students' technical skills to create positive social impact. We work with local nonprofits and public agencies to pinpoint their most pressing technical needs and scope viable, sustainable student projects that address them.  

In addition to these tangible projects, we also want to change the way that techies think of the public sphere. We are working with other organizations that share our mission, both locally and across the country, to coordinate events, hackathons, and fellowships that introduce students to the extent of what is possible when you code for good.

## MISSION STATEMENT
Code4Good seeks to develop technical solutions faces by the service and nonprofit communities, as well as foster enthusiasm in students to use their talents and abilities for the public good.

## GOALS
1. Learn about problems faced by the nonprofit and government communities, and devise with them innovative solutions using technology.
    * Establish working relationships with local nonprofits and public agencies
    * Determine projects of reasonable scale and support student developers in their work on each project
    * We actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process
2. Promote passion for innovation and service in the Yale community and beyond.
    * Value the lasting impact of involvement on each member of Code4Good.
    * Partner with Yale academic departments and student groups when possible, to integrate service into the growing coding culture on campus.
    * Maintain dialogue and mutual support with similar groups at other campuses.

## ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES & CODES OF CONDUCT
The Yale Code4Good Community expects that Yale Code4Good activities and events:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants and will not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy.
6. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
7. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
8. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology that others can use freely to improve their community also. Activities that aim to foster public use, not for private gain, are prioritized.
9. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
10. Work to ensure that all demographics present in the community are represented.
11. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
12. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.

### Terms
Board Terms will last from the spring through fall semesters, including the summer break. In the event that a board member steps down during the spring or fall semester, the Board may hold a Special Election (see below) to fill the board vacancy. In the event that a board member steps down during the summer break, the Board may directly select an interim appointee to fill the vacancy, who will serve until the end of the fall ternm.

Tech Team terms may vary depending on project scope and will be approved by the Co-Presidents and Director(s) of Projects.

### Board Elections
Board Members shall be elected by any and all members in good standing. Members in good standing include current members of Board, Tech Teams, and who have attended a majority of the monthly All-Member Meetings (see below).

The current Board shall announce a call for candidates no later than two weeks prior to a Board election. Board elections must be held no later than two weeks following the Thanksgiving Break.

In order to be eligible for elections, candidates must submit a candidate statement to the Board no later than ten days prior to the Board election. The Board must publish 

Board elections must be conducted in person. Board Members must be elected by a majority of voting members in good standing. In the event that a candidate does not win a majority upon initial ballot, the two candidates with highest number of votes shall enter a runoff second ballot. The current Board may decide the order of elections in any manner they see best fits the situation.

*Special Elections*
In the event that a Board Member leaves during the fall or spring semester (not including the summer), the Board may hold an election to fill the vacancy. A Board member selected through a special election must receive a plurality vote from members in good standing. The current Board may decide the additional terms and timeline of a special election in any manner they see best fits the situation.

### Technical Team & Team Lead Selection
Recruitment for Technical Team members and Team Leads will be conducted every semester, unless the current Board decides it would be in the best interest of the group not to hold recruitment. Recruitment must be held at least one semester per academic year. Technical Team members and Team Leads will be selected by the Board by simple majority.

## Norms & Accountability
This serves as a guideline for the regular operation of the group, and establishes a benchmark for expectations on the part of each officer. Norms should be reiterated on a regular basis, and made clear to all new members.

### Weekly Board Meetings
Board Meetings shall be held weekly, and are led by the sitting presidents.

Each officer must:
* Fill out the weekly task completion form (managed by presidents)
* Let others know if you can't make the weekly meeting at least 48 hours in advance
* Schedule a meeting with other officers to discuss your work upon missing 3+ meetings

### Timely Task Completion
Officers should schedule time after weekly meetings to work on tasks together when relevant. The president manages a Google form collecting weekly task update information, which should be submitted by all officers by the Saturday night prior to the meeting. When new tasks are established, certain tasks should be due earlier in the week (as opposed to the next meeting, and especially in regards to contacting people) so we can have timely responses and dialogue to discuss in the next meeting.

### Monthly All Hands Meetings
All Hands Meetings will be held monthly and may be attend by any member of Code4Good or greater Yale and New Haven communities.

Technical Teams must arrange to present on the status of their projects each All Hands Meeting, unless decided otherwise by the Co-Presidents and Director(s) of Projects.

All Hands Meetings must begin with a statement our mission statement, organizational values, and codes of conduct.

A portion of the meeting must be dedicated to allow any member or member of the greater Yale and New Haven communities to pitch suggestions or ideas for projects for Yale Code4Good to be involved in. The Co-Presidents may decide the additional terms and timeline of this discussion in any manner they see best fits the situation.

### Timely Task Completion
Board members should schedule time after weekly meetings to work on tasks together when relevant. The president manages a Google form collecting weekly task update information, which should be submitted by all officers by the Friday night prior to the meeting. When new tasks are established, certain tasks should be due earlier in the week (as opposed to the next meeting, and especially in regards to contacting people) so we can have timely responses and dialogue to discuss in the next meeting.

### Culture
Code4Good, especially as a student organization involved with work in the public sphere, values openness. This should be reflected in its group structure, dialogue among members, and communications with those outside the organization or Yale itself. In this manner, leadership should always be candid about the reasons behind their decisions. Furthermore, all projects created by Code4Good teams should be kept as open source, unless this conflicts with the best interest of Yale Code4Good or a partner organization as decided by the Co-Presidents.

It is equally as important for Code4Good to facilitate strong connections between its members. There should be regular social events to build lasting friendships within the organization as well as good working relationships. The most important resource in any group is its people, and the culture of Code4Good should encourage members to invest time in learning more about each other.

## Initiatives & Milestones
